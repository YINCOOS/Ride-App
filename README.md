## A RIDE-BOOKING APP
This is a project based on a ride order booking app that covers a wide range of geolocation built with google API, typescript, javascript, and react js, giving our customers the feel of accessibility to available and affordable means of transportation irrespective of where they are, so long our riders are situated in their respective locations.

This is an open-source code base, open to contributions from diverse developers around the world and we would be glad to collaborate.

This app allows users to book a ride with a nearby driver.

To use the app as a registered user, simply enter your current location and destination. The app will then show you a list of nearby drivers who are available to pick you up. You can then select a driver and book a ride.

The app will also show you the estimated cost of the ride and the estimated time of arrival.

Once you have booked a ride, you can track the driver's progress on the map. The driver will also be able to call you if there are any changes to the ride.

The app can be deployed for both Android and iOS devices.
